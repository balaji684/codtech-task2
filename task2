An easy and simple way of calculating the grade of the students.

while True:
    # Ask for the student's name
    print("Enter Student's Name: ")
    student_name = input()

    mark = []
    tot = 0
    
    print("Enter Number of Subjects: ")
    subNo = int(input())
    
    print("Enter Marks Obtained in " + str(subNo) + " Subjects: ")
    for i in range(subNo):
        mark.append(input())

    for i in range(subNo):
        tot = tot + int(mark[i])
    
    avg = tot / subNo

    # Determine the grade based on average
    if avg >= 91 and avg <= 100:
        grade = "A1"
    elif avg >= 81 and avg < 91:
        grade = "A2"
    elif avg >= 71 and avg < 81:
        grade = "B1"
    elif avg >= 61 and avg < 71:
        grade = "B2"
    elif avg >= 51 and avg < 61:
        grade = "C1"
    elif avg >= 41 and avg < 51:
        grade = "C2"
    elif avg >= 33 and avg < 41:
        grade = "D"
    elif avg >= 21 and avg < 33:
        grade = "E1"
    elif avg >= 0 and avg < 21:
        grade = "E2"
    else:
        grade = "Invalid Input!"
    
    # Print results
    print(f"{student_name}'s Grade = {grade}")

    # Ask if the user wants to enter marks for another student
    repeat = input("Do you want to enter marks for another student? (yes/no): ").lower()
    if repeat != "yes":
        break
